                        They are territorial animals, marking their territory with scent glands on their face and paws.
                        Play hunting is a common behavior for cats, reflecting their natural instincts. 
                         Understanding cat behavior can help foster a strong bond between humans and their feline companions, leading to a harmonious and enriched relationship.</p>
